Challenges faced:
1. Project Flow - Initially the project flow proved to be a difficult understanding. It required a considerable amount of time to navigate
through the interconnected modules.
3. Cart Page Implementation - The development of the add to cart functionality emerged as the most arduous aspect of our project. 
4. Debugging - Debugging became of the importance in the pursuit of identifying and rectifying subtle errors.
5. File Operations - Efficiently handling file operations, especially those related to reading and writing CSV files
